                        <ol>
                            <li>Act quickly. With severe bleeding, have the victim lie down. Call 911 or your local
                                EMS.</li>
                            <li>Control bleeding by applying steady direct pressure on the wound with sterile pad,
                                bandage or clean cloth for a full 5 minutes. Control the bleeding before trying to
                                clean the wound. Remove any jewelry from the area of the wound and if possible, hold
                                the part of the body that is bleeding higher than the heart. If blood soaks through
                                the cloth or pad, apply another one without lifting the first. If there is an object
                                lodged in the wound , apply pressure around the object, not directly over it.</li>
                            <li>If bleeding is controlled by direct pressure, apply bandage firmly to protect the
                                wound. Check pulse to be sure bandage is not too tight.</li>
                            <li>If bleeding is not controlled by use of direct pressure, apply a tourniquet only as
                                a last resort and then call 911 or your local emergency services.</li>
                            <li>If you are bleeding and have no one to help you, call 911 or your local emergency
                                services. Lie down, so your body weight applies pressure to the bleeding site.</li>

                        skin; absence of sweating; rapid pulse; confusion; convulsions; unconsciousness.

                        <h3>CAUTION</h3>
                        Heatstroke is a life-threatening emergency, and mostly occurs indoors in overheated, under

                            <li>Wrap victim in cold, wet sheets and use fans and air conditioners until body temperature
                                is reduced. If no sheets are available, cool the skin by sponging victim's body with
                                cool - not cold - water until temperature is reduced.</li>
                            <li>DO NOT give stimulating beverages, such as coffee, tea, or soda. DO NOT give alcoholic

                        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Act quickly. With severe bleeding, have the victim lie down. Call 911 or your local
                                EMS.</li>
                            <li>Control bleeding by applying steady direct pressure on the wound with sterile pad,
                                bandage or clean cloth for a full 5 minutes. Control the bleeding before trying to
                                clean the wound. Remove any jewelry from the area of the wound and if possible, hold
                                the part of the body that is bleeding higher than the heart. If blood soaks through
                                the cloth or pad, apply another one without lifting the first. If there is an object
                                lodged in the wound , apply pressure around the object, not directly over it.</li>
                            <li>If bleeding is controlled by direct pressure, apply bandage firmly to protect the
                                wound. Check pulse to be sure bandage is not too tight.</li>
                            <li>If bleeding is not controlled by use of direct pressure, apply a tourniquet only as
                                a last resort and then call 911 or your local emergency services.</li>
                            <li>If you are bleeding and have no one to help you, call 911 or your local emergency
                                services. Lie down, so your body weight applies pressure to the bleeding site.</li>

                                danger of a life-threatening emergency. Keep victim warm and still.</li>

                        <strong>First degree burns</strong> - redness or discoloration of skin surface; mild swelling

                        <ol>

                        If arms and legs are affected, elevate above heart level. Burns may be deep and potentially
                        serious, requiring medical treatment depending on extent and location. Be alert for signs of
                        shock and infection.

                        bluish-purple skin color, dilated pupils, unconsciousness.

                        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
                        <ol>

                                normally, yell for someone to call 9-1-1 and get an AED (Automatic External
                                Defibrillator), if available.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>If no AED is available, immediately start CPR, beginning with compressions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>COMPRESSIONS</h3>
                        4. Push hard and fast on the center of the chest 30 times, at a rate of at
                        least 100 compressions a minute. Push down at least 2 inches with each compression. If you
                        haven't been trained in CPR, continue to give compressions until an AED arrives or trained help
                        takes over.

                        <h3>AIRWAY</h3>
                        5. If you have been trained in CPR, continue CPR by <strong>opening the airway</strong> a head
                        tilt-chin lift.

                        <h3>BREATHING</h3>
                        6. Pinch the victim's nose closed. Take a normal breath and cover the victim's mouth with your
                        mouth, crating an airtight seal. Give two breaths (one second each). Watch for chest rise as you
                        give each breath.
                        <br>

                        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Act quickly. With severe bleeding, have the victim lie down. Call 911 or your local
                                EMS.</li>
                            <li>Control bleeding by applying steady direct pressure on the wound with sterile pad,
                                bandage or clean cloth for a full 5 minutes. Control the bleeding before trying to
                                clean the wound. Remove any jewelry from the area of the wound and if possible, hold
                                the part of the body that is bleeding higher than the heart. If blood soaks through
                                the cloth or pad, apply another one without lifting the first. If there is an object
                                lodged in the wound , apply pressure around the object, not directly over it.</li>
                            <li>If bleeding is controlled by direct pressure, apply bandage firmly to protect the
                                wound. Check pulse to be sure bandage is not too tight.</li>
                            <li>If bleeding is not controlled by use of direct pressure, apply a tourniquet only as
                                a last resort and then call 911 or your local emergency services.</li>
                            <li>If you are bleeding and have no one to help you, call 911 or your local emergency
                                services. Lie down, so your body weight applies pressure to the bleeding site.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Apply ice packs wrapped in clean cloth for 20 minutes on, 20
                                minutes off per hour. DO NOT use ice directly against the skin</li>
                            <li>Blot gently; apply a dry, sterile pad if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Usually medical treatment is not necessary; however if severe

                        If arms and legs are affected, elevate above heart level. Burns may be deep and potentially
                        serious, requiring medical treatment depending on extent and location. Be alert for signs of
                        shock and infection.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Third degree burns</strong> - deep tissue destruction with a white or charred
