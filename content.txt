Bleeding

*Before initiating any first aid to control bleeding, be sure to wear health care gloves to avoid contact of the victim's blood with your skin.

TREATMENT
1. Act quickly. With severe bleeding, have the victim lie down. Call 911 or your local EMS.
2. Control bleeding by applying steady direct pressure on the wound with sterile pad, bandage or clean cloth for a full 5 minutes. Control the bleeding before trying to clean the wound. Remove any jewelry from the area of the wound and if possible, hold the part of the body that is bleeding higher than the heart. If blood soaks through the cloth or pad, apply another one without lifting the first. If there is an object lodged in the wound , apply pressure around the object, not directly over it.
3.If bleeding is controlled by direct pressure, apply bandage firmly to protect the wound. Check pulse to be sure bandage is not too tight. 
4. If bleeding is not controlled by use of direct pressure, apply a tourniquet only as a last resort and then call 911 or your local emergency services.
5. If you are bleeding and have no one to help you, call 911 or your local emergency services. Lie down, so your body weight applies pressure to the bleeding site.

Breathing Problems

SYMPTOMS
<strong>May include:</strong> Shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, rapid pulse, bluish-purple skin color, dilated pupils, unconsciousness.

TREATMENT
1. Make sure the scene is safe
2.Shake the victim does not respond, and the victim is not breathing or not breathing normally, yell for someone to call 9-1-1 and get an AED (Automatic External Defibrillator), if available.
 <ul>
 <li>If you are alone, call 9-1-1 and get an AED if available. Follow the AED's voice prompts.</li>
 <li>If no AED is available, immediately start CPR, beginning with compressions.</li>
 </ul>

 COMPRESSIONS
 4. <strong>Push hard and fast on the center of the chest 30 times,</strong> at a rate of at least 100 compressions a minute. Push down at least 2 inches with each compression. If you haven't been trained in CPR, continue to give compressions until an AED arrives or trained help takes over.

 AIRWAY
 5. If you have been trained in CPR, continue CPR by <strong>opening the airway</strong> a head tilt-chin lift.

 BREATHING
 6. Pinch the victim's nose closed. Take a normal breath and cover the victim's mouth with your mouth, crating an airtight seal. Give two breaths (one second each). Watch for chest rise as you give each breath.
 7. Keep giving sets of 30 compressions and two breaths until the AED arrives or trained help takes over.

<i> The treatment steps summarized above are based on the American Heart Association guidelines on the administration of adult CPR by a nonprofessional rescuer.</i>

<li><strong>If a broken bone pierces the skin and there is bleeding, cover wound with sterile pad or clean cloth and apply pressure to control bleeding</strong> DO NOT try to straighten limb, return it to a natural position, or replace bone fragments. Do not touch wound directly. Secure a sterile pad or clean cloth firmly in place over the wound; tie with strong bandages or cloth strips but do not cut off circulation.
